# Contributing to lobid-resources


Welcome! Thank you for contributing to lobid-resources.

## How can I contribute?

Follow the instructions from [metafacture-playground's CONTRIBUTING.md, section "How can I contribute?"](https://github.com/metafacture/metafacture-playground/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#table-of-contents).

**Note**:

we differ from the above documentation when doing **Pull Requests**(PR).
As a functional review of a PR normally needs a full indexing, which takes around 18h, the PR should not be linked to the issue by a "closing keyword" but with a "See", eg "**See #2002.**". So if the PR is merged and thus closed, it doesn't trigger the closing of the issue automatically. The issue should be revisited after weekend's deployment and checked if the PR indeed has solved the issue. It is then closed manually.

**If** an issue is **assigned** it shall always be clear for the assigned what is expected of her. E.g. one could assign and comment with: "Check after weekend's deployment".

To have the Issue and also the PR appear at [lobid-resources' GitHub Board](https://github.com/orgs/hbz/projects/11/views/1) add them via **Projects**  (see at the right side). Change the Status properly, e.g. to "Review). Don't forget to also assign the PR and the Issue.
