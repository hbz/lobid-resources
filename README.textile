h1. About

Transform MAB-XML to JSON for Elasticsearch indexing with "Metafacture":https://github.com/culturegraph/metafacture-core/wiki used by the upcoming API 2.0 for "lobid resource":http://lobid.org/.

This repo is going to substitue big parts of https://github.com/lobid/lodmill .

The aim in API 2.0 is to make things easier, i.e.:
* get rid of hadoop
* concentrating only on lobid-resources (and not also gnd, lobid-organisations etc.)

h1. Build

"!https://secure.travis-ci.org/hbz/lobid-resources.png?branch=master!":https://travis-ci.org/hbz/lobid-resources

Prerequisites: Java 8, Maven 3; verify with @mvn -version@

Create and change into a folder where you want to store the projects:

* @mkdir ~/git ; cd ~/git@

Build the hbz metafacture-core fork:

* @git clone https://github.com/hbz/metafacture-core.git@
* @cd metafacture-core@
* @mvn clean install -DskipTests@
* @cd ..@

Build lobid-rdf-to-json:

* @git clone https://github.com/hbz/lobid-rdf-to-json.git@
* @cd lobid-resources@
* @mvn clean install -DskipTests@
* @cd ..@

Build lobid-resources:

* @git clone https://github.com/hbz/lobid-resources.git@
* @cd lobid-resources@
* @mvn clean install@

See the @.travis.yml@ file for details on the CI config used by Travis.

h1. Example of getting the data

In the online test the data is indexed to a living elasticsearch instance.
This instance is only reachable within our internally network, thus this test
must be executed manually. Then elasticsearch can be queried like this:

    @curl "http://gaia.hbz-nrw.de:9200/resources/resource/HT002619538"@

The result shows the data which also Hbz01MabXml2ElasticsearchLobidTest produces.
